    title: "Are we ready for naive vision systems?"
    abstract: "There is a lot of hype about using data driven vision systems for anything from
autonomous driving to surgery. Deploying vision systems in the real-world is a
major challenge. The average grocery store has 45,000 different items for sale.
IKEA has 228 product categories on their website. They sell 12,000 different
products and most of them are composed of 10+ items so the product inventory is in
excess of 100,000 items. Building intelligent systems that interaction intelligently
with so many different objects poses a challenge. We will discuss some of the lessons
from Tsotsosâ€™ complexity level analysis and what it tell us about the design of
robot systems. We will use examples from manufacturing, autonomous driving and
home assistants to illustrate impact across areas."
