              <p>John Tsotsos recently turned 65! To honour John’s many contributions in the visual sciences and longevity, we are holding a one day event — a verbal Festschrift if you like — on Saturday May 12th, 2018 at York University in Toronto, Canada. We will have a number of talks from distinguished researchers in areas in which John has contributed, as well as a number of talks by his academic children.
<br><br>
We are currently finalizing the details for the event, e.g., coffee breaks, name tags, and seating. We ask you to please RSVP below.
<br><br>
If there is any further information that you might need, do not hesitate to contact Kosta Derpanis at <a href="mailto:kosta@scs.ryerson.ca">kosta@scs.ryerson.ca</a>. John’s Festschrift is being held the day after <a href="http://computerrobotvision.pagecloud.com">AI/GI/CRV</a> which is also being held at York University.</p>
